This means that as of this date, most Windows 10 systems will cease to be eligible for support including important security patches. Without appropriate mitigation, Windows 10 systems will be non-compliant with multiple RPI security policies and may be denied access to the campus network in order to reduce risk and maintain a secure cybersecurity posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about sharing your news or events, or to change your subscription settings, visit &lt;a href="http://morningmail.rpi.edu"&gt;morningmail.rpi.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>Community</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 12:33:05 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://dotcio.rpi.edu/announcements/dotcio-announcing-microsoft-windows-10-support-ends-10142025</guid></item></channel></rss>
